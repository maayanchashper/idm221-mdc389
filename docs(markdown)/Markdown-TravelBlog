### About Me:

I am Israeli-American and speak both English and Hebrew fluently. My family and I moved to Maryland before the age of one and I grew up there until I moved to Philadelphia for college.

I am passionate about design, technology, volunteering, marine preservation, photography, and traveling the world. 

Travel is important to me because I love nature, culture, and putting myself outside of my comfort zone. I am a very active person who loves to do activities like hiking, surfing, kayaking, sightseeing, biking, and exploring new areas. I love experiencing new cultures and learning from those cultures. When I travel I try my best to immerse myself into the culture of the place I am in. Traveling to various places takes a lot of planning, budgeting, learning, and adapting. This is why it can put you outside of your comfort zone. I believe that this is a great thing because it allows one to overcome challenges and to gain experiences one never thought they would have.

My favorite activities are snorkeling and SCUBA diving. I’ve always loved the ocean and learned how to snorkel with floaties when I was two years old! I obtained my first SCUBA certification when I was twelve years old and obtained my advanced certification when I was sixteen years old. I now have more than thirty-five dives. I volunteered at two organizations throughout high school. I volunteered as a kids counselor in the Tzofim Tzabar, a youth movement for Israeli, Hebrew speaking children. I also volunteered as a swim coach at the Gudelsky Exceptional Swim Program. As a coach, I provided aqua-therapy to children and young adults with physical disabilities and cognitive impairments. In addition, I always played sports growing up and mostly did gymnastics, swimming, and volleyball.

I am currently a User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University. So far I have developed skills like UI design, Adobe Suite artmaking, prototyping, and product ideation! I began exploring User Experience and User Interface (UX/UI) design as a Junior in high school by working as a UX/UI Design intern at Product Savvy Consulting Firm for a year. The majority of my work led to the development of my Figma skills. Additionally, I held a two month summer UX/UI Design internship at GenLogs from June to August 2024. In this position, I focused greatly on UX, as I met with customers and gathered feedback multiple times each day. I also assisted with design mockups for the product’s UI.

### About Blogs:

I have been wanting to make a blog website for my travels for a long time now. My goal with this website is to make it easier for teenagers and young adults (like me) to decide on destinations and to plan their trips. A trip for a seventeen to twenty eight year old (for example) can look very different from a trip for a married couple with kids. And over the past few years, I have found that it is very time consuming to plan trips, especially for teens and young adults who are new to traveling, have unique wants, and are new to planning their own travels. My hope is that with this blog, I can give insights, tips, and recommendations to other teenagers and young adults who would like to travel in the same way that I do.





# Bahamas - September 2024
### Sun, Sand, and Adventure: A 19-Year-Old's Dream in Nassau, Bahamas

#### Day 1: Arrival and Beach Vibes
As soon as we stepped off the plane in Nassau, the warm, tropical breeze enveloped us like a cozy hug. My best friend, Lio, and I could hardly contain our excitement. We were finally here! Our home for the next six days was a charming hotel right on Junkanoo Beach. The soft white sand and stunning turquoise water were everything we had dreamed of.

After dropping off our bags, we immediately hit the beach, soaking up the sun and taking in the breathtaking views. We sipped fresh coconuts while giggling about the adventures that lay ahead.

#### Day 2: Exploring the Straw Market and Culinary Surprises
The next morning, we strolled through the famous Straw Market. It was a treasure trove of colorful crafts and local goods. We chatted with artisans and picked up some handmade souvenirs, but we quickly realized that the prices were a bit higher than we had anticipated. A lesson learned!

For lunch, we decided to dive into some local cuisine and ordered conch fritters. Honestly, they were a culinary revelation—crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. A perfect snack for our beach day!

#### Day 3: Thrills on the Water
This was the day we had been waiting for: jet skiing! The thrill of zipping across the ocean was exhilarating. Lio and I laughed uncontrollably as we raced each other, splashing through the waves and soaking up the sun. Afterward, we calmed our adrenaline with a snorkeling trip. Diving into the vibrant underwater world was like stepping into a different universe, filled with colorful fish and stunning coral reefs.

#### Day 4: The Ultimate Excursion
Our highlight was definitely the excursion we booked. We boarded a boat with a group of fellow travelers, buzzing with excitement. Our first stop was a snorkeling paradise; the water was crystal clear, and the fish darted around us as we floated above them.

Next, we had a chance to turtle watch! The gentle sea turtles were such a sight, gliding effortlessly through the water.

Afterward, we made our way to a beach club for lunch and drinks. The tropical cocktails were a delicious blend of fruit and rum, and the laid-back vibe was perfect for relaxing.

But the real magic happened when we set off to meet the famous swimming pigs! Imagine our excitement as we waded into the shallow water, where these adorable pigs came swimming right up to us. We held, petted, and even fed them. It was an unforgettable experience that felt straight out of a fairytale!

#### Day 5: Diving Deeper and Local Flavor
The next day, I went on a two day dive on my own. The underwater world captivated me once again. From colorful corals to curious fish, every moment felt like a dream. After surfacing, Lio and I took a stroll around town, immersing ourselves in the local culture. We visited some shops and sampled street food, although we had to brace ourselves—everything seemed a bit pricier than we thought it would be!

#### Day 6: Farewell, Paradise
As our final day in Nassau rolled around, we made sure to catch the sunset from the beach. The sky exploded with shades of orange, pink, and purple—a perfect end to an incredible trip.

On our last night, we visited a local distillery. We sampled rum and learned about the island’s rich history. The evening ended with laughter and chatter as we reminisced about our adventures, the stunning water, and all the unforgettable moments we shared.

#### Conclusion: Memories Made
Nassau was everything we had hoped for and more. The beauty of the ocean, the thrill of our excursions, and the laughter we shared made this trip one for the books. While the food was more expensive than we expected, the experiences we gained and the memories we made were absolutely priceless. If you ever get the chance, dive into Nassau—you won't regret it!

The underwater world was amazing! We swam with schools of colorful fish, and I even spotted a couple of eels peeking out from their homes. The best part? We saw sharks! They glided gracefully through the water, and I was in awe.

I’ve spent many school breaks visiting my family in Vaughan, Canada. Over the years, I’ve traveled there with my parents and brother many times to see my aunt, uncle, and my four amazing cousins. Each visit is filled with laughter, love, and unforgettable memories, whether it’s in the winter wonderland or the sunny summer days.

My winter trips to Vaughan are nothing short of magical. Every time we arrive, I’m greeted by beautiful, fluffy snowflakes falling from the sky. There’s something so enchanting about the way the world transforms into a winter wonderland!

One memorable visit was during the most extreme snowstorm I’ve ever experienced. The snow piled up so high that we couldn’t leave the house for days. It was like being in a snow globe, with pure white snow blanketing everything outside. My cousins and I built the biggest snow fort in the backyard, laughing and throwing snowballs at each other.

When we weren’t outside, we spent hours jumping on the trampoline (even in the snow!), playing with the family dog, and enjoying cozy meals together. We would gather around the dinner table, sharing stories and enjoying my aunt’s delicious cooking. Those moments of family bonding are what I cherish the most.

#### Summer Adventures: Fun in the Sun

When summer rolls around, Vaughan transforms again, and my visits become all about sunny fun! The warm weather means more time spent outside, and of course, more trampoline jumping!

One of my favorite summer activities is going out on my cousins' boat. We’d all pile in and head out to the lake, where we would swim, jet ski, and splash around. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of racing across the water with the wind in my hair! One night, we even slept on the boat. It was such a cool experience, snuggled up under the stars with my cousins, sharing stories and giggling until we fell asleep.

We still made time for family dinners, and the local malls became our hangout spots. I loved exploring the shops and picking out new clothes or snacks. Every day was an adventure, filled with laughter and the joy of being with family.

#### Conclusion: Memories to Last a Lifetime

Whether it’s building snow forts in the winter or enjoying boat rides in the summer, my trips to Vaughan are always filled with love and laughter. I feel so lucky to have such a wonderful family to visit, and every moment spent with them—playing with the dog, sharing meals, or just hanging out—becomes a treasured memory.

I can’t wait for my next adventure in Canada, and I know that no matter the season, it will be filled with beautiful moments that I’ll cherish forever!

# Israel - Born here and visited countless times

### A Love Letter to Israel: My Journey Through the Land of My Roots

#### Introduction: Finding My Heart in the Homeland

This is my journey and deep connection to Israel, a place that has shaped my identity in ways I can’t fully express. Born in Ramat Gan and raised in the U.S., I’ve visited Israel more times than I can count, each trip deepening my love for this vibrant country. Whether it's the bustling streets of Tel Aviv or the serene beaches of Eilat, Israel feels like home.

Eilat is another place that holds a special spot in my heart. The food, the beaches, and the scuba diving opportunities are unparalleled. Two of my favorite beaches there are Dolphin Reef, where I snorkel and dive among colorful fish and playful dolphins, and Mosh's Beach, named after the famous Israeli singer Mosh Ben Ari. Both spots offer a unique atmosphere that perfectly complements the lively Eilat vibe.

The nightlife in Eilat is also something to rave about. Whether I’m dancing the night away at a club or enjoying a laid-back evening at a beach bar, the fun never stops. The shops and markets are perfect for picking up souvenirs or local crafts to bring back home, reminding me of the beautiful memories made during my visits.

My love for Israel was amplified by my childhood experiences at summer surf camps. I spent countless summers riding the waves and making lifelong friends. Those moments taught me not only to embrace the ocean but also to appreciate the friendships I formed during those carefree days.

Additionally, I participated in a month-long travel camp that took me across the country. We explored historical sites, from ancient ruins to modern cities, deepening my understanding of Israel’s rich history. Each experience left an imprint on my heart, reinforcing my connection to this amazing land.

#### A Transformative Study Abroad Experience

One of my best Israel adventures was studying abroad in Hod Hasharon for five months. This opportunity allowed me to truly understand the complexities of its history. I traveled the country extensively, from the bustling streets of Jerusalem to the serene beauty of the Galilee.
The friendships I formed during this time were unforgettable. My classmates, teachers, counselors, and staff made my experience rich and fulfilling. Together, we shared laughter, explored new places, and learned from each other, leaving me with lasting memories and connections.

Each trip back to Israel is also a chance to reconnect with family and friends. My grandma in Rehovot always welcomes me with open arms, and the warmth of my relatives makes every visit special. The joy of gathering around the dinner table, sharing stories, and relishing homemade meals is something I look forward to every time.

I try to visit Israel as often as I can because it’s more than just a destination for me; it’s where I feel rooted and connected to my heritage. Every trip feels like a reunion with a part of myself, and I cherish every moment spent in this beautiful country.

#### Conclusion: Forever in My Heart

#### Thrills and Chills: Zip Lining and Rappelling

For those seeking adventure, we went zip lining through the lush canopy—a thrilling experience that had our hearts racing! The views from above were spectacular, and I loved the rush of flying through the trees. Rappelling down into the depths of a cenote was another unforgettable experience. It was a mix of excitement and nerves, but the sense of accomplishment afterward was incredible.

#### Beach Fun: Sandcastles and Snorkeling

Back at the beach, my brother and I spent countless hours building sandcastles, letting our creativity run wild. We decorated our sandy creations with seashells and twigs, turning them into elaborate forts.
Snorkeling was another highlight of our beach days. We donned our masks and fins, diving into the crystal-clear waters to explore the colorful underwater world. Swimming among vibrant fish and coral reefs felt like being in a completely different universe, and we loved every moment.

#### Poolside Relaxation and Family Fun

The resort’s pool was another favorite spot for our family. We splashed around, played games, and enjoyed quality time together. Whether it was racing across the pool or lounging on floaties, every moment was filled with laughter and joy.

In the evenings, we dined at various restaurants, trying delicious local dishes. From fresh seafood to savory tacos, each meal was a delightful experience. We even joined in on some lively dancing, letting the rhythm of the music guide us as we celebrated our time together.
