    As soon as we arrived in Istanbul, my mom's friend greeted us with open arms and two adorable cats. Her home was filled with warmth, and we instantly felt at home. We dropped our bags and set out to explore the city together.

    Walking through the streets, we were captivated by the beautiful stray cats that seemed to inhabit every corner, lounging in the sun and adding to the city’s charm. Colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, creating a picturesque backdrop as we wandered from shop to shop, indulging in local treats.
