    Exploring the Culture: Embracing the Locals
</h3>

<p>
    As soon as we arrived, we were eager to immerse ourselves in the local culture. We spoke with native Peruvians, and I was fascinated to hear them converse in Quechua, the ancient language of the Inca. Engaging with locals gave us a unique insight into their way of life and traditions, making our trip feel even more meaningful.
